// Scheme represents a ring signature scheme. All ring signature operations must
// be performed in the context of a scheme, and all protocol participants must
// share the same scheme.
//
// Schemes can either be generated or loaded. Scheme generation is performed by
// calling a New* function for the desired scheme — a task normally performed by
// a trusted authority. The scheme can then be exported and distributed to the
// protocol participants, who duplicate it using a Load* function.
//
// Key generation occurs by calling KeyGen on the scheme. The resulting key pair
// can be saved, and the public key can be independently exported for
// transmission to other parties.
//
// Signatures are generated using the Sign method. Sign will return a signature
// or an error in case of failure. Rings must have at least two public keys in
// them, and one of the public keys must match the signing key pair. There must
// also be no duplication of public keys in the ring.
//
// Signatures are verified using the Verify method. The given ring must be the
// same as the one used to sign the message (e.g., it may not be a subset or
// superset).
//
// All keys and signatures must be loaded in the context of a scheme using the
// Load* methods.
